      <p class=margin-p text-center">In 1988, adults and children alike were introduced to the terror of Chucky the
        killer doll with the release of Child’s Play. Directed by Tom Holland (no, not that one) and written by Holland,
        Don Mancini, and John Lafia, the supernatural slasher film tells the story of a widowed mother who inadvertently
        gifts her son a doll possessed by the soul of a dead serial killer named Charles Lee Ray. The movie, and its
        foul-mouthed pint-sized villain, gained a cult following and spawned a massively successful media franchise
        including six sequels, merchandise (yes, you can buy the Chucky doll for yourself!) comic books, and a recent TV
        series.

        But long before Chucky dealt his first killing blow or made his first quip, there was another devilish doll
        making himself a household name. To understand the cursed doll that predates Child’s Play and its massive media
        footprint, we must go back to the 1900s and meet a young boy, who, like many other children, grew incredibly
        attached to his favorite toy. Unlike most toys, however, this one came with a curse attached. This is the story
        of Robert, a simple doll that would go on to become one of the most infamous haunted objects in the world.

        On October 25, 1900, Robert Eugene Otto was born to the wealthy and prominent Otto family. The first few years
        of his life were pleasant, if uneventful. Robert, or “Gene” to his family, was a polite, friendly child. He
        spent his days toddling around in the Florida sunshine, dressed in a white sailor suit. When Gene was four years
        old, however, he received a very special gift that would become his new best friend. Gene’s grandfather, who had
        been abroad in Germany, returned to Florida with a stuffed doll. The doll was large, standing at three feet
        tall, with a fabric face and eyes made from little black beads nestled into sockets. As soon as Gene laid his
        eyes on the doll, it was love at first sight. He declared that the doll would be called Robert, using his own
        first name (though he didn’t go by it anymore), and his family dressed it in one of his old sailor suits.

        Now that they dressed alike, and had the same first name in common, an inseparable bond had been forged.
        Wherever Gene went, Robert would surely go too. It all sounds a bit like the setup for a quirky coming-of-age
        movie about a little boy and his favorite toy going on adventures together and learning valuable lessons along
        the way. Unfortunately for the rest of the Otto family, they were in an entirely different kind of story.

        In our second episode of Insidious Inspirations, we’ll explore the true story of Robert The Doll. Our story
        starts simply enough; small household accidents like broken vases and spilled milk were blamed on the doll.
        Then, Gene’s parents begin hearing their son whispering to his doll late at night, which they chalk up to their
        son being just a young kid. But that all changes one night, when Gene’s parents are awoken to screaming, and the
        sounds of smashing objects.</p>
